                <h2>Drawing Styles</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>There are multiple drawing styles that may peak interest. Some of the most popular and common ones are doodling, cartoons, photorealism, and line drawing.
                    The key is finding a passion or style that you enjoy and working on those skills. It takes time an patience but the benenfits are worth it in the long run. Best thing to do is just grab a peice of paper and pencil and try it!
                One of my favorite styles is skecting with a pencil using lines. 
               <p> Line drawing, just as the name suggests, entails using lines to create a picture. The style is simple and elegant. Beginners prefer line drawing as it is easy to create and takes a shorter time compared to other styles like the use of dots or shading.</p>
