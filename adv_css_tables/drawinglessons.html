                <p>When you think of drawing it can be intimidating. Especially, if your point of view is that only people with a natural talent or artisic skills can draw. 
                   Honestly that isn't the case. Anyone can draw, the only question is how much time and effort do you want to apply.
                   All it takes is a vision of what you want to put on the paper and practice the fundamentals until you reach your own expectations. It doesn't matter what others think it's about how you judge your own artwork!
