        <h2>Trade Anywhere</h2>
        <h3>Access Trading and Investing Anywhere</h3>
        <p>The thought of day trading from a mobile device or laptop was unheard of twenty plus years ago. The fact that you can invest or trade from your very own smart phone has completely changed the industry. For example, image being on vacation soaking up the sun on the beach and making $1,000 from taking a trade on your phone? Seems crazy right? Well it's far from crazy and actually the reality of what trading is today.</p>

        <h3>Forex Market</h3>
        <p>The foreign exchange market is an over-the-counter marketplace that determines the exchange rate for global currencies. It is, by far, the largest financial market in the world and is made up of a global network of financial centers that transact 24 hours a day, closing only on the weekends. It's amazing to think the stock market normally trades around 100-300 billion dollars a day, where as the Forex market being traded globally has an average of three Trilion plus dollars traded daily. This is where you can make an enournous amount of wealth!
