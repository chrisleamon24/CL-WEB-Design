        <h2>What is Trading and Investing?</h2>
        
        <p>Trading involves buying and selling assets such as stocks or crypto for short-term gains. Traders primarily focus on share prices as they make their decisions. Investors, on the other hand, focus on long-term gains when they buy and sell investments.</p>

        <h3>Stock and Crypto Exchanges</h3>
        <p>A stock exchange trades in company stocks or shares, while a cryptocurrency exchange trades in cryptocurrencies (digital currencies), such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and many more. You have to join or sign up with a particular broker in order to trade, buy, and sell stocks. It does matter what broker you use. Here are a few different facts about investing and trading. I've also shared a few different brokers listed below.
            <li><a href="https://coinbase.com" target="_blank">Coinbase</a></p>- 
                Crypto is a volatile market and can be a gamble. The risk to reward can be very high. </li>
            <li><a href="https://robinhood.com" target="_blank">Robin Hood</a></p>- Buying and selling stocks is more of a long term hold. You can also trade options which can bring in more short term gains. Although options are risky!</li>
            <li><a href="https://carboncapitalfx.com" target="_blank">Carbon Capital</a></p>- Day trading in the forex market is one of the topic trading exchanges and Carbon Capital is one of the best brokers!</li>
