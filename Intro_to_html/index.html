   <p>What comes to mind when you think of American football? Does it seem like it's just a bunch of players on a field throwing a ball around? A bunch of men in tights?  
     Well football is alot more than that. Football is a game of intense athlectism, will power, mental focus, endurance, and teamwork. Football is a game that brings a crowd
    of stangers together cheering on a team to victory. </p>

<p>Football season is right around the corner! I personally can't wait to see my favorite teams back in action on the field.
    Football is one of the best sports around. NCAA starts September 2nd in just two weeks. I'm hoping to see UGA go for their third shot at the national championship.
    No matter what team you are a fan of I hope you enjoy the season. Let's get this year started and go DAWGS!
